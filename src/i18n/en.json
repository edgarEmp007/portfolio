    "body": "I spent 7+ years building and scaling complex applications for one of Mexico's largest universities. I saw firsthand how a single vulnerability, left unchecked, can compromise an entire system. My journey into cybersecurity wasn't a career change; it was a specialization. I don't just find vulnerabilities—I understand how they were built in the first place. My experience as both a developer (Dev) and a security professional (Sec) is the foundation of DevCybSec."
